> ‚ö†Ô∏è üå± This project is newly sprouted! So please consider it a beta: Remember to backup all data and please use version control.

The WikiBonsai project[^ai] transforms a collection of markdown files into a text-based, easy-to-navigate [jungle gym for thought][wikbon-doc-philosophy--a-jungle-gym-for-thought][^mind] with an [API for the mind][wikbon-doc-design--an-api-for-the-mind][^mixed-metaphors]. This is accomplished by enabling personal knowledge management (PKM) workflows that rely on `[[wiki]]` syntaxes, "[semantic trees][reddit-musk]" ("knowledge bonsais"), and data visualizations that are viewable on screens or in augmented/virtual reality.

This project is about strategically implementing functionality that will benefit the most users and developers across the digital ecosystem. Thus, it abides by the [Unix Philosophy][art-unix-phil]: Everything is modularized and implemented in such a way as to maximize re-use whether it be for the browser, desktop, mobile, or headset. It's about furthering the state of PKM as a whole by building atop "[standardization bedrock][wikbon-doc-design--drilling-down-to-standardization-bedrock]" instead of just creating a single application.

Further, these workflows may also facilitate the mapping of [semantic space][wikbon-doc-design--semantic-space] which could prove an invaluable resource in building a better understanding of how neural nets work and furthering the development of effective, explainable AI.

Only time will tell how far this path may [go][wikbon-doc-philosophy--finding-free-will].

## Notable Workflows

These are the workflows the WikiBonsai project enables for markdown-based collections of notes:

1. Mechanics to build a unified "[semantic tree][wikbon-repo-semtree]" or "knowledge bonsai" across a collection of markdown files.
2. Expanded syntax for [`[[wikirefs]]`][wikbon-repo-wikirefs] for quick associative linking (a.k.a. "wikilink", "bidirectional link", "internal link", etc.).
3. Graph utilities to visualize the relationships formed by the syntaxes 1 + 2 and unify them into an interactive "[memory palace][memory-palace]".
4. A lean, [yaml][yaml]-like [markup language for attributes][wikbon-repo-caml-mkdn] (with `[[wikiref]]` support).

A "digital garden" may be considered a "WikiBonsai" if it supports [`[[wikirefs]]`][wikbon-repo-wikirefs] and [semantic trees][wikbon-repo-semtree].

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Note

The systems you interact with have an effect on the way you think. This system is meant to provide a ["jungle gym for the thought,"][wikbon-doc-philosophy--a-jungle-gym-for-thought] but it can't do everything and might even have negative consequences if used improperly. Here are some supplemental suggestions for adopting a framework such as this, especially for educational purposes:

### Write Full Essays

The workflows this project enables are meant to help develop an explicit relationship with the words you use. It's possible over-reliance on a tool like this (like many other digital productivity tools) can allow, or even facilitate, overly modular and fractured trains of thought. Writing [full essays][utb-essay] can combat fractured thinking and exercise those parts of the mind.

### Refer to Common Cultural Reference Points
###### (such as [britannica][britannica] or [wikipedia][wikipedia])

By adopting a tool specifically meant for mapping vocabulary, it can be tempting to use niche words or make up one's own to demarcate an idea. But too much of this risks building a Tower of Babel and losing the ability to communicate effectively with others. Use shared vocabulary where you can and if you've found a word of better fit, use it with others. That is the purpose of language after all.

### There is Never a "Final Word"

Like this project it is best to view a set of notes and explicit knowledge as a current state of affairs -- it's the state of the trail; of how much clutter has been cleared away. The goal is to build a navigable path for yourself, but to remain aware of what other things lie beyond the already-explored path. Always be open to what hard reality is telling you, especially while getting your hands dirty.

### Get Your Hands Dirty

The digital world cannot replace practical, hands-in-the-mud experience. No matter what you learn or study be sure to learn something, _anything_, that requires your hands in the real world.

## Forward

As with pretty much all human endeavors, this project does not represent any kind of "final word" or "best solution" but a "clearing of brush" or "cutting away the chaffe"...Of making the road ahead a touch less bumpy and a bit more wonder-full for those that follow.
